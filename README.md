# Trajectory-Generation-for-Quadruped-2-link
The generation of smooth, steady motion gait trajectories for a quadruped with 2-link legs. These trajectories are synthesized using the original data from the 3-link legged quadruped obtained in the MSc(Eng) project as truth data in a non-linear least squares optimization.
